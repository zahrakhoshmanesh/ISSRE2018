Classroom 227 , Monday, October 15th, 2:00PM - 5:30PM (3:30PM-4:00 Coffee break),
**Tutorial 2: Anomaly Detection in Networks.**

Speaker: **Veena Mendiratta (Nokia Bell Labs, USA)**

 **Abstract**

The application of analytics methods to data collected from communication networks provides valuable information about the network state, and for detecting and predicting anomalous behavior in the network. Large volumes of operation data, including textual and log files, are collected from communication networks; and the inherent value of this data is recognized by academics, practitioners as well as network operators, who need easy to use and robust methods to detect and analyze anomalies based on the network data. The anomalies are indicators of vulnerabilities in the network. From an operations perspective, it is important to detect the anomalies and correct the problem (based on knowing the root cause) in a timely manner. The goal of this tutorial is to deliver a balanced mix of theory and hands-on practice. The first part of the tutorial will focus on introducing analytics methods for network anomaly detection. Next, a real-world case study is presented applying non-parametric machine learning techniques and PCA based methods to detect anomalies in wireless networks. Once an anomaly is detected, message patterns are analyzed for root cause analysis by comparing the message patterns of the anomaly data to those of the normal data to determine where the problems are occurring. Neural network based Kohonen Self Organizing Maps (SOMs) and visual analytics are also used for exploring the anomalous behavior. Data from a 4G network will be used for the analyses. The case study is significant, as communications traffic on wireless networks generates large
volumes of log metadata with hundreds of fields including error codes on a continuous basis across the various servers involved in a communication session. The last third of the tutorial will provide a hands-on session where attendees will be guided in the analysis of real log data using the techniques described above, in particular, the use of Kohonen SOMs. The hands-on session will focus on exploratory data analysis and modeling approaches using the provided (real) datasets. The hands-on session will be conducted using: the R software environment, the rstudio user interface for R, and various R packages.
